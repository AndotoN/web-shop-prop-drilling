# Web Shop with React (Prop Drilling Approach)

This project is a web-based shop application built using React. It allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage item quantities. The app is designed with a modern, clean interface using Tailwind CSS for styling and follows React's best practices for state management and component structure.:

üöÄ Features
* Product Listing: Browse a variety of products displayed in a responsive grid layout.
* Shopping Cart: Add items to the shopping cart, increase/decrease quantities, and remove items if needed.
* Dynamic Cart Updates: The total number of items in the cart dynamically updates as you add or modify items.
* Modal Integration: The cart is displayed in a modal that opens when the "Cart" button is clicked.
* Prop Drilling for State Management: The project uses prop drilling to manage state across components, ensuring proper data flow without the need for complex state management libraries.
* Fully Functional and Styled: The app is designed with a polished, professional look, leveraging Tailwind CSS for smooth transitions, hover effects, and responsive design.

üõ†Ô∏è  Technologies Used
* React: For building the user interface and managing component-based state.
* Tailwind CSS: For styling and making the UI clean, responsive, and elegant.
* JavaScript: For handling business logic and state updates.
* HTML5: For structuring the content of the app.

üìÅ Project Structure
- App Component: Manages the global state (shopping cart) and serves as the root of the application.
